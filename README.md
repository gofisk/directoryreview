Iowa State University Directory Review Website

This site was setup to highlight security issues with Iowa State University's directory policies. Research was done to support all claims and statistics made on this site. As of October 16, 2018, Iowa State addressed these security issues and made significant changes to the directory policy which were sufficient to address these concerns. This site is now archived.
